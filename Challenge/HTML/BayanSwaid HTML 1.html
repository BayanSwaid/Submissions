    <h1>Is a College Degree Necessary for Success?</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="core">When you’re facing <i>thousands of dollars</i> in tuition costs and potential loan debt, it’s only natural to wonder if a college degree is worth it. The short answer is that it’s complicated. It’s difficult to provide mathematical proof that investing in a college education will provide real-dollar value throughout your life since there are many other factors at play. For instance, the type of career you want to pursue, how much you ultimately pay for college and where you live post-graduation can all play a role in the value of your degree.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p class="explanation">For some students, traditional college may not be the best choice if you want to work in a trade like plumbing or construction. However, that doesn’t mean your classroom days are over. If you ultimately decide not to pursue a bachelor’s degree, it’s still in your best interest to learn marketable skills through a vocational training program or a career school education.</p>
    <h2>A Degree Can Boost Your Income, and Improve Your Résumé</h2>
    <q class="core">According to the <strong>Bureau of Labor Statistics</strong>, earning potential and educational attainment are directly related. For instance, bachelor’s degree holders over age 25 earned an average of $1,137 per week in 2015 versus those who completed only high school and earned $678 per week. Degree credentials open up more doors to jobs that pay higher wages. Even for positions that don’t necessarily require college, having a degree is likely to put you at an advantage over a fellow qualified job seeker who did not finish college.</q>
