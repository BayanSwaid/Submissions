                <p>I want to be able to have a text description with each gallery. Since there is no editor in the foogallery custom post type, I experimented and tried adding the editor which worked fine but then I need to alter both the custom post type file and the (in this example) the gallery-default template. Which I think is bad practice. Is there a better way to add this feature? I tried making an extension on my own (via the added boilerplate) but my knowledge in coding is close to zero so I didnâ€™t succeed. Is this maybe a feature/function that might be added in a future release? It would be really handy and I noticed someone else asking the same thing before.</p>
